A passionate, hardworking and dedicated software engineer with a hands on practical approach centered around Python. 
I have gone beyond the python fundamentals to developing real web applications in Django and exploring 
data problems in data science. Currently I'm concentrating in data Science with thirst of constant learning. 
I enjoy using Linux OS from Data science handling to software development. 
It makes my life easier though I'm flexible with other operating Systems.
